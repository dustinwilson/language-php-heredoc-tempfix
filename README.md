# PHP language support in Atom with Heredoc tempfix

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to PHP files in Atom. Deletes a portion of the heredoc language grammar GitHub has spent the better part of three years arguing over. Heredocs are just text strings. While it would be useful to have syntax highlighting for code within heredocs it is much less useful to have a broken language grammar for multiple years.
